        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Nothing smells better than baking a batch of <strong>chocolate chip cookies</strong>. I remember my grandma baking me chocolate chip cookies every fall.</p>
        <p>This a great family boding time moment as well. <em>Kids</em> love to make a mess in the kitchen, lick the spoon, and enjoy the fruits of their labor.</p>
